# Intel GPUs

**Attention to all users, please note this guide and other khronokernel sites will be shutting down on April 16th, 2020. Reason for this is we've decided to move the guides to a dedicated organization to help simplify the hackintosh process and provide a single, trusted source for hackintosh information. This new organization will be known as [Dortania](https://github.com/dortania).**

Links to the new sites:

* [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/)
* [Getting Started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)
* [GPU Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/)
* [Wireless Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/)
* [Anti-Hackintosh Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Anti-Hackintosh-Buyers-Guide/)
